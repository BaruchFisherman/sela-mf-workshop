# Central Dependency Sharing

This demo shows how importmaps can be used to share resources between ESMs. Right now, native importmaps are only supported in Chrome. Additionally, the support in Chrome is restricted to inline importmaps.

For enhanced support check out [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs).
