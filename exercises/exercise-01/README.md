# Example 1

Derive a domain decomposition for Netflix. Their application consists of a video catalogue, previews, related content, popular videos, profile management, and a video player.

Questions:

* What teams should / have to exist and what are their subdomains?
* Which micro frontends (and components) could make sense?

Hints:

* Think about how the functionality given above can be grouped.
* Make a sketch (or get a screenshot) of the Netflix web application as you might know it - map the parts on the screen to different components belonging to different micro frontends / teams.
* Find out if the relationship between micro frontends and teams is 1-1 or if there are more micro frontends per team. When does that make sense and why?
